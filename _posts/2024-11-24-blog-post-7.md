### **The Elegance of Saying No: Reflection on finding Space in Tango, Coding, and Life**

Lazy Saturdays have become a cherished ritual—a time for family, rest, and resetting the week. Yet, yesterday, I fell into a familiar modern trap: unwinding with cat videos and mindless Netflix series. We all do it, don’t we? Shutting off our brains feels like relaxation. However, as the night unfolded, I realized this so-called "rest" had disrupted my sleep and left me feeling drained rather than refreshed.
In the midst of this, a tango performance video by Inés and  Hernán unexpectedly caught my attention. The elegance of their movements and the simplicity of their milonguero style stood out like a refreshing breeze amidst the modern ballroom tango fashion.

Unlike performances filled with intricate, technical sequences, this was pure and unpretentious. It wasn’t about showing off; it was about connection. Every step had purpose—no wasted movements, no rush. This simplicity created space: space for the dancers to flow with ease and for the audience to enjoy just right amount of artistic interpretation. It was a profound reminder of the power of minimalism and intentionality, not just in dance, but in life.

In dance, simplicity allows movements to breathe. In life, it clears the clutter—of our minds, schedules, and surroundings. Meditation clears mental noise. Cleaning declutters physical spaces. Training, whether in tango or coding, often focuses on finding the most effective, streamlined way of doing things. Even holidays, when used well, serve as a way to clear the backlog of daily life and create room to recharge.
Yet, how often do we undo these efforts? (If we converted the hours spent watching mindless videos into an hourly wage, the result would likely shock us.) Platforms like Netflix offer effortless entertainment at minimal cost. But what they often consume is our most precious asset: time. By saying yes to those videos, I was inadvertently saying no to rest that could have truly recharged me—or to creative pursuits that could nourish me.

Watching that tango performance made it clear: Saying no is not about deprivation. It’s about protecting the space for and give highlights to what truly matters. Minimal steps, executed with precision and purpose, are far more powerful than fancy tricks.

This realization can also be extrapolated in coding, simplicity is elegance. A clean, efficient algorithm doesn’t just work better— stripping down to essentials creates clarity and impact. As the famous quote goes, "The best code is no code at all."

Similarly, in life, fewer unnecessary commitments mean more room for intentional, meaningful actions. Saying no clears the way for a resounding yes to the things that truly matters, to us personally. Every “yes” is, by definition, a “no” to anything else what one has not chosen. Time is finite, and each choice shapes how we spend our one precious life. Saying yes to simplicity—whether in tango, coding, or daily living—isn’t just about efficiency. It’s about creating enough space for what truly matters.

It’s not easy. The modern world inundates us with options, information, and distractions. But perhaps that’s why the art of saying no is more important than ever. It’s a practice of reclaiming agency, of cutting through the noise to find the rhythm of what truly matters.

The elegance of the milonguero style, the clarity of clean code, the peace of an uncluttered mind— the beauty of space. So now: What am I saying no to by saying yes to this, really?

Have a good Sunday!<br>

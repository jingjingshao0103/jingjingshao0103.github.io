### I did copying the Heart Sutra!

Yesterday, I visited one of the most renowned Buddhist temples in Shanghai, a place that has been a part of my life since childhood. This temple, where my mother and I would go each year, holds a special significance for me. Over the years, it has grown and transformed with the city—expanding its boundaries, becoming shinier and more glamorous, and accommodating far more visitors than before. Yet, amidst the changes, there are aspects that have remained comfortingly familiar: the background chant of the sutras, the serene figures of the Buddhas, and the distinctive taste of the simple noodles served in the canteen.
As a child, I often questioned the purpose of visiting the temple. Why would people pray for things that either required personal effort or seemed entirely unattainable? How could the Buddha possibly attend to the countless wishes of so many devotees? Every child sees the world differently. However, with the passage of time, my perspective has shifted. I’ve come to understand that our existence, as individual human beings, is minuscule in the vast expanse of the universe. Spiritual strength offers us hope and solace in the face of life’s natural brevity and unpredictability.
On this visit, I had a new experience: hand-copying the Heart Sutra. It was an activity that blended meditation with mindfulness, a ritual that calms the mind and draw focus. The process involved several steps—washing hands as a gesture of purification, engaging in a short meditation, offering prayers, copying the sutra, concluding with a final prayer, and submitting the completed work to a collection area.
The act of copying the sutra was akin to an extended meditation session. As I carefully traced each character, a myriad of thoughts and sensations arose. My mind was filled with unnecessary worries: Would there be enough ink to finish the sutra? Was my handwriting too clumsy? I envied those who seemed to write more gracefully and faster than I did. I questioned the meaning of the sutra, my reasons for copying it, and even the necessity of finishing it in the chilly weather. But as I sat with these doubts and discomforts and decided to continue copying the sutra, they gradually dissolved. My focus shifted solely to the process, and an incredible sense of relaxation and calmness took over.
This experience aligns with a profound concept I read recently:
"Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space lies our freedom and power to choose our response. In those choices lie our growth and our happiness."
From a scientific perspective, meditation promotes neuroplasticity—the brain's ability to reorganize itself by forming new neural connections. Studies show that consistent meditation increases the density of gray matter in areas associated with learning, memory, and emotional regulation. This "space" between stimulus (our random thoughts) and response is exactly where we can choose how we react and foster growth.

Through this experience, I also had a profound realization: struggles and boredom (the stimuli) are inevitable in any endeavor, regardless of its nature. The challenges we face can feel overwhelming, tempting us to give up. But this is simply part of the process. Toward the end of the sutra-copying process, I felt a lightness and a deep sense of satisfaction that made the effort worthwhile. This realization is something I’ve carried into my daily life, particularly as I work on implementing a complex workflow for a project. The doubts about my own capabilities and the moments of frustration are considerable, but I try to calm these uncomfortable thoughts and keep myself moving forward.

Copying the Heart Sutra was not merely an act of devotion; it can be seen as a mirror reflecting the patterns of struggle and triumph in life. It reminded me of the importance of patience, focus, and the value of persistence. Most importantly, it reaffirmed that the light at the end of any challenging process is what makes everything worthwhile.

Interestingly, in the classic Chinese tale Journey to the West, there is also a chapter referencing the Heart Sutra. What a coincidence that this profound text continues to weave itself into our stories.

### Tango! Tango! Tango!

Tango, tango, tango. For the past 11 years, it has been an integral part of my life. From the fiery enthusiasm of my early days to the steady rhythm of weekly rituals—practicing, attending lessons, and going to milongas—it has served as a mirror to my growth.
Yet, there were moments of frustration, times when I questioned whether tango had overshadowed other aspects of my life. I often asked myself: Do I still love tango? What has it meant to me over the years?
To explore these questions, I decided to engage deeply with others in the tango community, exchanging stories and insights to better understand the tango.
Recently, I had the privilege of sitting down with one of my favorite tangueras from Shanghai. Reserved yet intensely disciplined, she has made remarkable progress in both dancing and DJing, leaving an indelible mark on the local tango scene. What followed was a captivating conversation about her journey, philosophy, and unwavering dedication to tango.
Our conversation began with her bold assertion:
"I don’t buy into the word ‘talent.’ It’s only an excuse to intimidate people. I trust the hours and effort that people put in."
This belief underpins her disciplined approach. For her, success in tango—or any pursuit—isn’t about innate ability but about consistent effort. She dedicates about an hour daily to training, and a day without tango feels incomplete.
When I asked what tango means to her, her response was thoughtful:
"There are many interpretations of tango, but for me, it’s very defined—a specific dance, at a specific time, with specific music."
As an introverted INFJ, she finds in tango a rare outlet for authentic self-expression, free from societal roles or expectations.
"Tango allows me to be whoever I am," she said.
Tango is freedom—a profound expression of self through music and the silent conversation shared with a partner in embrace. It allows me to feel deeply, to embrace sorrow, nostalgia, and loss, and ultimately to savor joy. It is, in every sense, a celebration of humanity.
Her style is well defined—traditional, polished, and deeply rooted in the salón technique.
Recently, she has also embraced the role of a tango DJ.
"I really like to listen to the music—really listen. As a DJ, I have to imagine whether dancers will enjoy it, whether they’ll feel the mood to dance," she explained. Her sensitivity to the music, coupled with her growing experience, has made her invaluable in the community.
But things are hard in the beginning. She reflected on her early days in tango:
"At first, I’d sit through entire nights at milongas without being invited to dance. I learned to enjoy just listening to the music. Those nights motivated me to improve. Without them, I wouldn’t have grown so much."
Her determination also shines through in her approach to competitions, which she sees as opportunities for growth rather than milestones of achievement.
"Even without a partner, I still take part in Jack and Jill competitions. It’s almost a responsibility for someone physical capable in the tango community to strive to get better."
When I asked about the sacrifices she’s made for tango, her response was resolute:
"If you truly love something, the investment doesn’t feel like a sacrifice. It’s worth it."
Her preference for traditional tango reflects her deep respect for its history and artistry.
"In the early days, people were poor, yet they bought paste to shine their shoes and dressed up properly. I admire that attitude," she said. Her personal style, always polished and intentional, mirrors this ethos.
"You have to embrace the whole package of tango. I know the path I’ve chosen—traditional tango—is a lonely one, as modern tango becomes more popular. But that’s okay. I’m fine with being the ‘loner’."
One of the most striking moments in our conversation came when I asked her to rate her tango:
"Three out of ten," she admitted. But when asked to rate her relationship with tango, her answer was different entirely:
"Ninety-nine out of a hundred. Every part of my tango could improve, but I am glad to have found it."
I also asked if she felt it was too late to pursue a professional career. She answered with quiet determination:
"I have what I have. I wish I had found tango earlier, but it is what it is. What matters now is how wisely I use the time I have left."
As we wrapped up, one of her remarks from a DJ night a few days ago resonated deeply with me:
"It’s rare to find something you truly love. When you do, you want to spend as much time with it as you can."
Thank you Francy for taking the time! What a pleasure.
Hope you all enjoy the Chinese New Year Holiday.

Love ❤️,<br>

### The Gentle Art of Reading: A Path Beyond the Self

In the rush of daily life, it’s easy to become consumed by the endless dialogue of the self. Thoughts spiral around *me*—my feelings, my identity, my contributions. This self-centric focus can be exhausting, not only for others but also for oneself. Holding tightly to the capital *I* creates tension, trapping us within our own internal chatter.

Reading offers an escape from this relentless loop. It is not merely an activity but a profound release—a reprieve from the incessant weight of the self. Books, crafted with care and revision, are structured and deliberate. They invite us to listen deeply and patiently to someone else’s thoughts, sharpening our focus and expanding our perspective.

Countless times, in moments of confusion or frustration, I’ve found wisdom in a single sentence—its clarity cutting through my turmoil, as though touched by divine insight. A book doesn’t demand; it waits quietly, like a wise and understanding friend. Often, it feels as though the book has found *me*. Its nourishment is both intellectual and emotional, offering truths that endure far longer than the fleeting satisfaction of material things.

Revisiting books also illuminates our personal growth. Take *Journey to the West*, a cornerstone of Chinese literature and the origin of iconic stories like *The Monkey King*. As a child, I delighted in its adventures and vivid characters, eagerly following the journey to see if they would finally reach the West and obtain the sacred scriptures. Now, with a more mature perspective, I marvel at its intricate storytelling, vivid depictions of nature, nuanced critiques of society, and its profound lessons on coping with life’s struggles.

Similarly, *The Unbearable Lightness of Being* remains a timeless favorite of mine—read in Chinese, English, and German (how I wish I could read it in French!). The complexity of its relationships and the philosophical exploration of pleasure, guilt, desire, responsibility, and the weightlessness of existence strike deep chords. It unveils the intricate emotional and psychological terrain that exists beyond reason, revealing the hidden corners of human longing and vulnerability.

This layered richness in books reflects why I write. Writing, like reading, is a dive into the flow of thoughts. It is a calming and comforting practice that demands structure and clarity, transforming the chaos of my mind into something meaningful. The kind and thoughtful feedback I receive on my writing is immensely encouraging, reminding me of the deep connections words can create. Writing and reading are complementary acts—both opening pathways to understanding and release.

Books, then, are far more than stories. They are portals to broader, richer, more vibrant worlds. They remind us that the self is not the center of all things and that profound fulfillment lies in engaging with ideas beyond our own. Through reading, we step outside the narrow confines of *me* and catch a glimpse of infinite possibility.

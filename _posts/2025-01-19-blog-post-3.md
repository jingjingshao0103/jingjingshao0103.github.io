### Vision! Vision! Vision!

**“Jingjing, what is your vision for this project?”**
This question lingered long after a Monday conversation at work. It wasn’t just about strategy or planning—it felt like an invitation to explore what vision truly means to me.

For many of us, questions about vision bring back memories of job interviews: *Where do you see yourself in five years?* But vision, as Stephen Covey explains in *The 8th Habit*, transcends these scripted moments. He writes:  
*"Vision is the ability to see a future state with the mind's eye. Vision is applied imagination. All things are created twice: first, a mental creation; second, a physical creation."*  
Vision is not just setting goals or daydreaming; it’s about intentionally using imagination to craft a mental blueprint for the future.

As children, we were natural visionaries. We dreamed of being astronauts, writers, scientists, musicians—or even the “cool godfather.” Our imaginations were limitless, unbound by practicality or societal expectations. The ceiling above our beds became a canvas for bold possibilities during sleepless nights.

But as we grew older, life began to tame us. Teachers, parents, and authority figures encouraged us to “be realistic” and “follow the rules.” We learned to prioritize good grades, secure jobs, and respected roles, often at the expense of personal aspirations. Pleasing others became a silent mandate, and by adulthood, many of us found ourselves consumed by the daily grind.  
The wild dreams of youth? Buried deep in a neglected mental backlog. Even those who achieve the so-called “dream job” may hear a quiet voice asking: *Is this all there is?*

Rediscovering vision as adults isn’t about retreating into childhood fantasies. It’s about revisiting the creativity of our youth with a wiser, more pragmatic lens. The questions shift:  
1. **What is my vision for my life?** Or more simply: *Where do I want to be one year from now?*  
2. **What steps do I need to take to realize it?** What resources—time, money, skills, or connections—will I need?  

While the process begins with imagination, it demands effort, discipline, and strategic thinking.

## The Neuroscience of Vision  
Science backs the transformative power of vision. Our brains remain malleable throughout life—a concept known as **neuroplasticity**. This is why we can acquire new skills and reshape our thinking at any age.

Visualization plays a critical role in this process. When we imagine a goal, we activate neural pathways associated with that experience. With repetition, these pathways strengthen, much like muscles during exercise.

Books like *The Source* by Dr. Tara Swart delve into the neuroscience behind visualization. Tools such as vision boards focus the mind and reinforce desired outcomes by blending attention, intention, and emotion.  
Fascinatingly, research shows that simply imagining physical movements can lead to measurable strength increases. A colleague once validated this idea with humor during the pandemic, remarking on my habit of watching tango videos: *“You’re mentally practicing the dance!”*

The popular saying **“Fake it until you make it”** also aligns with this principle. By convincing the brain that you’ve already achieved your vision, your actions and decisions naturally begin to align with that belief, gradually making the imagined future a reality.

However, vision alone isn’t enough. Execution requires discipline, careful planning, and periodic readjustment. A well-thought-out strategy bridges the gap between the mental creation of a vision and its physical realization. This involves prioritizing steps, analyzing resources, and staying adaptable to challenges and setbacks.  
The process can be messy—filled with trial and error, frustrations, and unexpected detours.

But the most empowering realization is this: **every individual has the capacity to reinvent their life.** Vision is the spark that ignites this transformation. It’s not about indulging in fantasy but about crafting a future that aligns with your unique skills, talents, and values—while contributing meaningfully to others.

Yes, it’s easier said than done. The path will require patience, resilience, and recalibration. But the journey is worth it!
 
So, let your imagination take the lead. Train your mind to embrace the endless possibilities, and pair that vision with intentional, purposeful action. The power to shape your future is already within you—waiting to be realized.

**Wishing you a wonderful Sunday filled with creativity, joy, and delicious self-made dumplings!**

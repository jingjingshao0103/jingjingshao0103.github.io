### **Relaxing into the floor**

Often, we find ourselves carrying tension in our shoulders and hips without even realizing it. After a long day of work, a gentle stretch or an occasional massage may offer some relief. Yet, these post-workout or post-stress treatments only scratch the surface; they don’t address the root cause. The real issue, as I see it, is that over time our bodies seem to forget how to fully relax. The constant build-up of tension becomes our baseline, and we lose touch with what it feels like to simply be at ease - the gentle feeling of safety and ease within our bodies.

One powerful antidote is found in yoga: the posture known as savasana. This lying-down posture, traditionally practiced at the end of a yoga session, may look deceptively simple. It involves lying still on the floor for 5 to 10 minutes, but in reality, it is one of the most challenging poses. David Swenson, one of my teachers, once remarked that savasana is the most important posture of all. It is during this moment that the body can absorb the energy (prana) generated from the practice. The physical stillness in savasana allows for a deeper internal process of renewal—an experience of letting the universe take care of us, of allowing nature to hold the path for us.

At first glance, it seems effortless—just lie down and relax. But for many people, this simplicity is hard to embrace, and sometimes, it’s even intimidating to lie down with strangers in the same yoga room. In our fast-paced, overstimulated world, we are no longer accustomed to the act of lying still without distraction. Even when we attempt to, the body tends to resist, fidget, or remain restless. The mind follows suit, racing through to-do lists, shopping plans, or anxieties about the day. Achieving that quiet, restful state is no longer second nature for many of us.

Fortunately, relaxation can be cultivated through practice. Once, Mechi, a yoga teacher I met in Buenos Aires, aware of how busy and chaotic the city can be, would tell her students to take 5 minutes to relax before practice. She would say, “Let your body find its calm after traveling through the city.” This simple yet profound advice can help prepare the body and mind to release tension and embrace stillness.

The beauty of "relaxing into the floor" lies in its ability to help us reconnect with the body’s natural state of ease. It’s not about pushing or forcing relaxation, but rather surrendering to gravity and allowing tension to melt away. As you lie down, feel the floor beneath you—supporting you—and gradually release the muscles, the breath, and eventually the mind. This practice is an invitation to return to the simple pleasure of just being. It’s a reminder of what it means to inhabit the flesh and spirit of being human, especially in a world that prioritizes hyper-functionality.

### **Review: *Atomic Habits* by James Clear**

I’m often skeptical of popular books, worrying their success might rely more on marketing than meaningful content. However, two weeks ago, I decided to give *Atomic Habits* by James Clear a try. (It was available in the store with a big discount—sorry, price does matter.) To my surprise—and not much surprise—this book offered practical advice that directly addressed a question I’ve been grappling with: **life is short, so how can I live a meaningful and good life?**  

The book approaches this question with a "divide and conquer" strategy, breaking down the grand pursuit of a good life into manageable, actionable steps—*atomic habits*. *(As a computational chemist, I couldn’t help but draw a parallel to the atomistic approach in quantum chemistry: understanding the universe by examining its smallest building blocks.)*  

*Atomic Habits* is an easy read, written in clear, accessible English that allows readers to focus on the ideas rather than getting bogged down by complex language. The concepts are straightforward yet profound, and they resonate deeply. Here are ten quotes that stood out to me, sparking reflection and offering guidance:  

1. **"And I knew that if things were going to improve, I was the one responsible to make it happen."**  
2. **"Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement."**  
3. **"A one-degree shift, seemingly no different at first, can unlock huge changes over time. Mastery requires patience."**  
4. **"Systems are about the processes that lead to results."**  
5. **"Behaviors are usually a reflection of one’s identity."**  
6. **"The process of behavior change always starts with awareness."**  
7. **"Cues in the environment have a stronger influence than self-control over the long term."**  
8. **"Remove the friction of taking action: addition by subtraction."**  
9. **"Genes matter."**  
10. **"The difference is that they still find a way to show up despite feelings of boredom."**  

Reading this reminded me of why Ashtanga yoga has become so integral to my life. At its core, yoga—especially the Ashtanga practice—is about building awareness: awareness of movement, breath, and ultimately, self. Like the book suggests, it’s a system that rewards persistence and discipline.  

Ashtanga has subtly shaped my identity. The daily practice demands commitment, yet the minimal setup—a mat, pajama, and your breath—removes barriers to starting. The community inspires deeper learning, and even boredom, which inevitably arises from repeating the same sequences, becomes a lesson in patience and consistency. This mirrors James Clear’s idea of finding freedom through habit and mastering boredom to unlock growth.  

In a way, yoga is one of my first *atomic habits*. It’s a small daily practice that compounds over time, bringing clarity, strength, and resilience. Much like James Clear’s book, it teaches me that meaningful change comes not from grand gestures but from the quiet persistence of showing up.
